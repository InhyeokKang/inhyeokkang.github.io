## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Convergence Software at Hallym University, focusing on wireless communications. My research interests include sensor networks, low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), maritime wireless communication, and wireless power transfer networks. In addition to my academic work, I have participated in multiple national research projects funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea and other agencies. These projects covered a wide range of topics such as secure vehicle data frameworks, wireless power transfer for IoT, electromagnetic field (EMF) safety in smart societies, and blockchain-based frameworks. Through these experiences, I have developed both academic expertise and practical skills to address real-world and industrial challenges.
